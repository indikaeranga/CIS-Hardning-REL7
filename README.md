# CIS-Hardning-REL7
CIS Hardening Script for CentOS / Redhat 7 Servers

This will ensure the security of servers with CIS standards / benchmarks. This script compatible with Centos and Redhat 7 servers up to 7.9 upgrade. There have seperate versions for centos 8.

There have 6 parts of the script. We can run all (./ all) parts as once. please replace script name. Otherwise we can run specific section.
(./ part1)

You can edit messages as you wish. I recommend to apply with TEST servers first and proceed to PROD.
